# Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant data. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze features such as income, credit history, education, and loan amount to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- File: `loan_data.csv`  
- Contains features like Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Credit_History, and Property_Area.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt` if available).
3. Run `LoanPrediction.py` to train models and see predictions.

## Results
- Both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were trained and evaluated.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were calculated.
- The Decision Tree showed slightly better performance on this dataset.

## Future Scope
- Add more advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost for improved accuracy.
- Implement a simple web or desktop UI for user-friendly loan prediction.
- Perform feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
